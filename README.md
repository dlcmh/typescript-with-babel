[It's 2020: let's build a node.js app with TypeScript](https://www.tomspencer.dev/blog/2020/05/22/its-2020-lets-build-a-node.js-app-with-typescript/)

## Notes

Ensure Visual Studio Code uses the workspace's TypeScript version rather than VSCode's.

To do this, open any `.ts` file and click on `TypeScript` in the lower right hand portion of the screen.

## Installation

```
npm install
```

## Compiling the project

```
npm run compile
```
